A simple Jarvis Project made by me, I have used many references to make this such as youtube, articles etc.
It's a very simple python project, I might work on it in future to improve it further.

Note- If you want to run it locally on your machine then don't forget to install packages such as "speech recognition" and "pyaudio".
